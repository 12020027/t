                <p>
                    Hassan Kamel Al-Sabbah was born in 1895 in the city of Nabatiyeh. His father enrolled him in primary school at the age of seven, where he impressed his teachers. He later joined the Sultan's School in Beirut in 1908, and it became evident early on that his knowledge and ambition far exceeded the academic curriculum.
                    Al-Sabbah joined the American University in Beirut, quickly mastering the English language. He was able to solve complex mathematical and physical problems with ease in his first year of university.

                    He directed his attention to studying the theories of scientists in the fields of atomic and relativity physics.
                    He was one of the few who comprehended the highly complex theory of relativity, writing articles explaining the concepts of relative time and space, temporal and spatial dimensions, mass, and energy. He was later described by the scientist Einstein himself as the only one who dared to discuss and critique Einstein's views on relativity."

                <h2>Achievements</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>His inventions began in 1927 with a pressure regulator device that determines the amount of electrical power required to operate various machines and the electrical pressure applied to them.</li>
                    <li>In 1928, he invented a television device that utilized the reflection effect of electrons from a thin phosphorescent film in a cathode-ray tube, an electronic device that allows both audio and visual transmission, enabling viewers to hear sound on the radio and see the broadcaster simultaneously. Additionally, he invented an image transmission device in 1930, which is used today in electro-optical imaging and serves as the foundation for modern cinema, especially CinemaScope, and television.</li>
                    <li>Al-Sabbah traveled to the United States and worked at General Electric, a company that awarded him a sum of money for every invention. In 1932, he was granted the title of 'Boy of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers' by the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, an honorary title given only to those who made significant innovations in the field of electricity. This title was awarded to only ten engineers in the company.
                        At the beginning of the year 1933, he was promoted within the company and was bestowed with the title 'Boy of Electrical Science' after being elected by the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in New York.</li>
                    <li>The newspaper "Al Nahar" published an article in its issue number 539, dated May 31, 1935, in which he claimed that he had managed to derive a secondary electrical battery that generates electricity when exposed to sunlight. He mentioned that this invention includes a panel made of Thallium Sulfate that converts the image into electrical signals. Solar cells and solar panels, known today, are nothing more than methods for converting solar energy into electrical energy, particularly used in remote broadcasting stations.</li>
